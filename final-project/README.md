# Ascii Conversion App
###
### So for my final project I decided to make an asci art app! I have always considered ascii art a type of computer magic more than science. When we are young we all looked at computers as moe magic than science and i felt that this project exemplifies that concept. Except now, thanks to cs50, i see that it is well, science.

### The app itself is rather simple in its organization. i have my final-project folder, and it it conatains a templates folder for my .html files, an upload folder and of course my App.py.
