To get an idea of the "Audio Aura" calculation that the Spotify Spotify Wrappped campagin is offering,
we must look over the specifiers that are used to breakdown the users playlist that we were given in
this example. The following table is an average breakdown of each of the major specifiers.

+------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+
| AVG(tempo) | AVG(loudness) | AVG(valence) | AVG(energy) | AVG(speechiness) | AVG(danceability) |
+------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 119.90418  | -5.67764      | 0.484443     | 0.65906     | 0.115569         | 0.71646           |
+------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+

This give us an idea
